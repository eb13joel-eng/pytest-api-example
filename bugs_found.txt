I used Pytest to test the API endpoints that are documented in SwaggerUI. 
The API runs with SwaggerUI documentation at http://localhost:5000, which 
I verified was accessible. I validated all responses against the schema 
definitions that correspond to the Swagger documentation.

BUGS FOUND DURING TESTING:

1. BUG in schemas.py:
   - Issue: "name" property was defined as "integer" instead of "string"
   - Fix: Changed type from "integer" to "string"
   - Impact: Schema validation would fail for all pet names

2. BUG in app.py (already fixed in provided code):
   - Issue: PATCH order endpoint now accepts 'available' status
   - The title mentioned this was fixed: "fix issue with patch order not accepting available status"

3. OBSERVATION:
   - The API allows updating order status to 'available', which makes the pet available again
   - This is working as intended after the fix

4. POTENTIAL ISSUE:
   - No validation for duplicate pet IDs when creating new pets
   - API returns 409 Conflict if pet ID already exists (this is good)
